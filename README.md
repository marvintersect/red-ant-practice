# Red Ant Tech Test

## Intro
Welcome to the Red Ant technical test! This is a simple project that fetches and lists comics from a Marvel API.

The test itself will be a pair-programming session, with a number of small tasks to complete within this project. The whole process will take 1 hour; a 5 minute intro, 45 minutes of development time and 10 minutes at the end for any questions.
