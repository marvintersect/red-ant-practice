# Red Ant Tech Test

## Intro
Welcome to the Red Ant technical test! This is a simple project that fetches and lists comics from a Marvel API.

The test itself will be a pair-programming session, with a number of small tasks to complete within this project. The whole process will take 1 hour; a 5 minute intro, 45 minutes of development time and 10 minutes at the end for any questions.

This is first and foremost an excercise to facilitate technical discussions, so completion of the tasks is neither necessary or expected.

Please feel free to use whatever means you need to complete the tasks. If you get stuck please do not hesitate to ask for help, or to use Google to find your answer - we know that this is an everyday part of development.

In preparation for your test, please check out this repo and have the app running.
